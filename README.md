# Bluebank_loan
 Blue Bank is a bank in USA that has a loan  department which is currently understaffed. They  supply loans to individuals and donâ€™t have much  reporting on how risky these borrowers are.  Using Python, they would like to see a report of borrowers who may have issues paying back the loan.

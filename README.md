# Bluebank_loan
Welcome to my Python data analysis project using a fictional Bluebank loan dataset. This project explores customer behavior, loan performance, and financial insights to support better decision-making in the banking sector.

 Blue Bank is a bank in USA that has a loan  department which is currently understaffed. They  supply loans to individuals and don’t have much  reporting on how risky these borrowers are.  Using Python, they would like to see a report of borrowers who may have issues paying back the loan.

🔍 Project Overview
In this notebook, I perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Bluebank dataset to clean the data set in the process of answering key questions such as:

•	What factors influence loan approval or denial?

•	How do age, education level, and marital status affect loan performance?

•	What trends exist across customer demographics?

I used pandas, matplotlib, numpy and json  to clean, visualize, and analyze the data.

🔄 The dataset was exported and will be fed into Tableau for interactive dashboards and deeper visualization.
